--[[
    Which items the window draws, in what order, under which category heading.
    Pure data: nothing here touches a frame.

    Both walks below take a `view` built once per redraw by ns.BuildRestockView --
    each item's group resolved a single time, and the filter text lowered a single
    time. That matters because the sort comparator asks for a group on every
    comparison: resolving it there made an item-cache lookup O(n log n) per
    keystroke in the filter box, on a path that already runs on every keystroke.

--[[
    The item-type group used for sorting and the category pane -- the exact WoW item class
    from GetItemInfo (e.g. "Consumable", "Weapon", "Armor", "Quest", "Trade Goods",
    "Miscellaneous"). Falls back to a stored type, then "Other" until the item is cached.
    Just-added items report the "New" group instead, until the window closes.

    One pass over the list, resolving per item what both walks below would
    otherwise resolve repeatedly. Rebuilt on every redraw rather than cached
    across them, because an item's group moves the moment its data arrives or it
    leaves the "New" set.

    The category pane's contents: every group present in the profile, with how many
    items each holds, plus the total.

    Counts are taken AFTER the text filter, so typing in the filter box narrows the
    categories along with the list and a category that no longer matches anything
    disappears rather than promising items it cannot show. The counts are the whole
    reason the pane earns its width, so they have to agree with what clicking one
    actually produces.

    New sorts ahead of everything else here: it is where the item just added went,
    and it is the one group that must never be filed alphabetically.
