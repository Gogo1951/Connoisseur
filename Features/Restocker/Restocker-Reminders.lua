    Resting status is the game's own "you are somewhere with vendors" signal --
    it turns on in inns and cities and nowhere else -- so it is what the reminder
    keys off rather than a zone list we would have to maintain.

    Only a not-resting to resting transition counts, so this reminds you on
    ARRIVING in town rather than every time the flag twitches while you are in
    one -- and logging in counts as arriving, see the arming block below.

    Three things reach the check, because one signal does not cover every way of
    arriving:

      PLAYER_UPDATE_RESTING  -- walking in. Fires on both edges and can repeat,
                                which the transition rule already absorbs.
      PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD  -- logging in, hearthing, portalling, or stepping
                                out of an instance. The resting flag is part of
                                the state the client syncs across a loading
                                screen, so no update event follows and
                                walking-in was the only arrival that ever fired.
      PLAYER_CONTROL_GAINED  -- landing off a flight path; see the taxi rule.

    Both halves are gated on actually being short of something: a reminder to
    restock when there is nothing to buy is noise too. All three settings ship on.
]]
local wasResting = nil

--[[
    A flight path crosses inns and towns the whole way, and the resting flag
    flickers on and off with them. None of those is an arrival -- you cannot
    shop from the back of a gryphon -- so a taxi counts as NOT IN TOWN for as
    long as it lasts, and the recorded state is forced to match. That is what
    leaves a genuine not-resting to resting edge for the landing to trip:
    PLAYER_CONTROL_GAINED re-checks once control is back and UnitOnTaxi has
    cleared, so touching down at a town flight master still reminds you.
]]

--[[
    The quiet window after a reminder. Arrivals cluster -- a hearth lands you in
    an inn inside a city, and a quick errand in and out of an instance re-crosses
    the same boundary -- and each of those is one trip to town, not three
    reminders. Measured from the reminder, not from the arrival, so a suppressed
    check (nothing short, everything off) never starts the clock.

    How long to let an arrival settle before reading it. Resting status and the
    bag counts the shortfall is built from both land after the loading screen,
    and after a flight the taxi flag clears a moment behind control returning --
    reading either too early reports the trip you just left.

    A login settles slower than a zone change and waits longer still -- past the
    loading-screen flurry, past the add-on's own post-login work, and well past
    the item queries behind a name-keyed list entry. The shortfall is read at the
    END of that pause, not the start, so a bag that finishes filling in the
    meantime is counted and a list that is no longer short says nothing.

--[[
    Nothing reminds until PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD has said what kind of entry this
    was, because the two kinds want opposite things and the resting events during
    a load arrive too early to tell them apart:

      Logging in IS an arrival -- you have just walked up to the game -- so a
      character who logs in resting gets the reminder. That was inconsistent
      before this gate existed: an inn happened to fire a late
      PLAYER_UPDATE_RESTING and a city did not, so the same standing-in-town
      login reminded you or did not depending on which side of the door you
      logged out on.

      A /reload is NOT an arrival. It records where the character already is --
      so the next real arrival still has an edge to trip -- and says nothing,
      which is the whole reason the flag is seeded rather than simply cleared.

    Left false until then, the check does nothing at all rather than recording
    state: a resting event landing mid-load would otherwise consume the very
    transition the login is about to report.
