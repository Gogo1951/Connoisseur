    for a friend without firing scrolls on themselves).

    PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED fires on every tab, and a rebuild is a full bag
    rescan, so an unconditional request there costs one of those per mob
    targeted. Only three things about a target reach a macro body:

      is it a friendly player  -- scroll suppression (ns.HasFriendlyPlayerTarget)
      is it the player         -- plain-food mode (targetingSelf in ns.ScanBags)
      its level, when it is a  -- the conjure downrank cap (ns.GetSmartSpell),
      friendly player             which reads no other target's level

    Those three ARE the whole of what a target contributes to a written body,
    so anything new that reads the target MUST join this signature or its macro
    goes stale. Same diff-before-requesting shape ns.OnUnitAura uses on
    UNIT_AURA, and the group signature and ns.PetFoodQuestsChanged use on the
    other firehoses.

    GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE fires on every raid roster change, yet the only group
    state a written body reads is whether the player is grouped and whether that
    group is a raid (the group-restricted modes, ns.IsModeActive). Hunters'
    QUEST_LOG_UPDATE fires on every objective tick and is diffed by
    ns.PetFoodQuestsChanged in Tools-Hunters.lua.

    Left nil until the first firing, so the first reading always counts as a
    change rather than being compared against a state nobody has read yet.

    PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED runs in combat, where the client can restrict unit
    comparisons (Forever): UnitIsUnit then returns a secret value, and testing
    it errors. While C_Secrets says the comparison is off, the self reading
    keeps its last value, so a restricted read counts as unchanged, never as a
    flip.
