    Covered means a flask, or two DIFFERENT elixirs. Counting distinct auras is
    the whole test: the client only lets one battle and one guardian elixir sit
    on a character at once, so two elixir auras are already one of each and
    nothing here needs to know which kind either one is (see Data/Elixirs.lua).

    Returns true while the data tables are empty, so the check reads as "nothing
    to report" rather than firing on every character until the rows are pasted
    in. An empty table cannot tell a flasked player from an unflasked one, and
    of the two silences that is the right one.
